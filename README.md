# Password Generator

## Description

The Password Generator is an application that enables employees to generate secure passwords based on their selected criteria.

This application will run in the browser, featuring HTML and CSS powered by Javascript.

- The motivation for this project is to make secure password generation quick and easy for end users.
- Passwords are required for nearly every user-interface nowadays.
